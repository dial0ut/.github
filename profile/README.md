### *VPN so good snowden wouldn't have gotten caught*


Dialout is a company that puts web services in the hands of users. Think of it as a VPN on steroids. Using passwordless login (coconut credentials), metadata protection, and data ownership everything from personal AI applications to enterprise security has gotten a whole lot easier.


Dialout leverages the power of the [NYM mix network](https://nymtech.net/), TOR, and wireshark to create a personal, private, and (most importantly!) programmable experience with the web. Use all the apps you love without worrying about Big Tech watching you at a personal level and rest assured with enterprise security.

+ Completely localised traffic 
+ Minimised attack surfacce
+ Amplified privacy
